<p>Woodward says: <br /> &lsquo;I found her image immediately striking with her long red hair and white stewarding coat. She is holding her own guinea pig called Gentleman Jack&hellip;.. There is something unsettling about the austere background and the scratch on her hand&rsquo;</p>

<p>21 October 2011, 11:00 &ndash; 12:00</p>
<p>2011 marks the third and final year of <em>Chasing Mirrors</em>, a partnership project between the National Portrait Gallery and community organisations in Brent, Barnet and Ealing, funded by the John Lyon&rsquo;s Charity. Each year a contemporary artist has collaborated with young people to explore the Gallery&rsquo;s Collection and create artwork based on concepts of identity and self-representation. This year British-Iraqi artist Athier Mousawi is leading the collaboration; his work uses geometric Islamic shapes and Arabic calligraphy to explore themes of exile, upheaval, integration and celebration. Athier engages with the viewer not by presenting a bleak present, but by using comical figures and abstract elements. However hard a topic, Athier&rsquo;s work actively encourages hope through colour and form. A display of the collaborative work produced will be exhibited in the Studio Gallery from October 14<sup>th </sup>2011.</p>

<h2>Meet the Artist: Joe Simpson</h2>
<p>27 June 2011, 11:00-12:00</p>
<p>BP Portrait Award Artist Joe Simpson is a figurative painter currently living and working in London. His paintings have been shown both nationally and internationally, including at Urbis, Manchester City Art Gallery, Cornerhouse and The House of Commons. Simpson works primarily in oil paint to create images that utilise the conventions of cinematography to present &lsquo;staged&rsquo;, fictitious scenes where time has been stopped and extended. These frozen moments are deliberately ambiguous, inviting the viewer to inject their own emotions, motivations and narrative into the scene.</p>
<p>Simpson&rsquo;s BP Portrait Award 2011 entry, of Faithless&rsquo; Maxi Jeff is part of a recent project of oil paintings of his favourite musicians, including Vampire Weekend&rsquo;s Ezra Koenig, The National&rsquo;s Matt Berninger and Iron &amp; Wine&rsquo;s Sam Beam.</p>

<h2>Meet the Artist: Brendan Kelly</h2>
<p>14 October 2009, 11.00 - 12.00</p>
<p>Former BP Awards candidate Sadie Lee will be discussing her own painting practice, including her sometimes controversial choice of sitter, on 14 October from 11.00 - 12.00.</p>
<p>Sadie Lee's imaginative paintings were first bought to wider public attention when her double portrait 'ERECT' was selected for exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in the BP Portrait Award 1992. The image - two severe looking women sitting with arms interlocked glaring back at the viewer - was produced as a poster to advertise the annual BP Award, and within weeks all 5,000 copies had completely sold out. The same year Sadie captured media attention as organiser and curator of the ambitious project 'Exposing Ourselves'. The aim of the London-based show was to bring together the diverse talents of over sixty international artists. As well as showing at the National Portrait Gallery, Sadie has had several solo shows nationally and abroad. These include 'Venus Envy' at Manchester City Art Gallery and 'A Dying Art - Ladies of the Burlesque', an exhibition resulting from winning the BP Travel Award which then toured the UK for a year after showing at the National Portrait Gallery. Sadie has also had an exhibition titled 'Don't Look' at the Gallery of Modern Art, Slovenia where she was selected as the British representative in the international contemporary art festival.</p>
<p>In October 2006, Sadie Lee spent time with Holly Woodlawn, one of the last surviving members of Andy Warhol's &lsquo;Factory' inner circle and the star of cult films <em>Trash</em> and <em>Women in Revolt</em>. Born Harold Ajzenberg in Puerto Rico, 1946, she took the name &lsquo;Holly' from the heroine of Truman Capote's <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>. Sadie spent every day for a week in Holly's Los Angeles apartment, making studies of Holly as the basis for a series of oil paintings. The paintings show Holly in all her incarnations, with and without make-up, wig and frock. These are not just pictures of a man dressing as a woman; Holly is both male and female and neither. She is, above all, a Superstar.</p>

<p>This year, our new Secondary Programme offers sessions around Image and Identity. To explore these further, we have expanded our Meet the Artist scheme to accommodate and explore identity in a wider context, investigating issues such as diversity and cultural representation through the experience of individual artists and their work. This academic year we will be inviting a variety of artists to present, share and discuss their approach to image and identity within their own lives and working practice. Suitable for KS3 to 5, it will cover aspects of Citizenship, Art and Design, PSHE, Sociology, History, English Language, Philosophy and Politics.</p>
<p>As well as responding and questioning the artist, students will be encouraged to access the collections and use the Portrait Explorer our interactive digital guide to the collection, to expand their ideas for further classroom study and to debate and illustrate individual responses to Image and Identity.</p>
